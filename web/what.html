Some time ago, <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a>, an online comic, released a comic called
'Tamagotchi Hive':

I happened to be at a time of my life where I wanted to take on a new project to do, but didn't have any
access to my normal hardware tinkering tools: I only had my laptop and the Internet. I knew that
a hacker called <a href="http://natashenka.ca/">Natalie Silvanovich</a> already managed to 
<a href="http://www.kwartzlab.ca/author/natalies/">reverse engineer</a> the Tamagotchi and 
dump the internal ROM. In the meanwhile, the datasheet for the microcontroller running the show
also became available on the Internet, allowing me to make a rudimentary but functional
Tamagotchi emulator. I added some state-machine-based 'artificial intelligence' to it to 
keep the Tamas alive and happy, and some logic to make them able to communicate with eachother
and a webserver. The end result is the website you're looking at.</p>

<p>
<strong>But what is the use of the website?</strong><br />
Nothing. I made it because it entertains me, and I hope it will be able to entertain others too. You
can view it as an art project, if you so please.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Your AI is going haywire! It does strange things and not what it needs to do!</strong><br />
Yes, the AI is far from perfect, and sometimes it misses a button press or seems to give priority
to the wrong thing. It is mostly self-correcting, though: usually after 15 minutes or so, it works its
way out of whatever situation it got itself into and will take good care of its Tamagotchi again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>But I want to play with the Tamagotchis!</strong><br />
Sorry, that's not possible. The AI is running the show. Don't worry, while the AI may not be that
intelligent and sometimes seems to do something stupid, it has never killed a Tamagotchi or made
it unhappy for a long amount of time. The Tamagotchis are well cared for.</p>

<p>
<strong>I still wanna play!</strong><br />
Then go and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=tamagotchi">buy one</a>! That
way, you also support Bandai, the company who made these wonderful little devices.</p>
